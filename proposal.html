    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    <!--Problem description-->
    <section>
        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p> Chess is an age old game that people have played to challenge each others intellect.
            Classically, chess has been played using wood or some equally sturdy material to form
            the board and pieces necessary to play. These were all physical objects you manipulated
            in real life in order to play with a person in front of you. But now, in a digital world,
            we can play chess with someone across the world and challenge their minds against ours. 
            However, the current services in place that allow this kind of functionality are inconvenient
            for friends looking to find the service with a google search and play a quick 
            game of chess. Often times these services require you to register online, or download an app to play.
            For example, if you type chess online as a google search, the first two options are play chess online against
            a computer, and the second is play chess online multiplayer. The first isn’t what we’re looking for so we 
            click the second option. The website has a clear Play Now button but when we click that it immediately asks us
            to register. After we register, we have to authenticate our email and only now can we move on. This is a
            cumbersome process that is only worth it to someone interested in continually using the online 
            chess services in place. This doesn’t benefit those wanting to quickly play one game and then never 
            use the service again.

    <!--App description-->
    <section>
        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>This is the problem I want to address. I would like to create an online chess app that targets 
            those people who want to play chess online, using a quick google search to find a one time service. 
            Most people know of chess and with devices all around us capable of going online, chess is available 
            to anyone that actively wants to play. With this in mind, I am targeting people who casually play chess 
            and want a convenient, and fast solution where they can ask a friend to play chess and be playing within 
            a minute. However, I intend to make this service useful for people who regularly play chess and use the 
            service as well. The app will be capable of playing a full game of chess against a player, and after 
            the game the users can then register for the service and save game information such as names, whether 
            they won or lost, and a win to lose ratio. This addresses the problem by providing a simple service 
            that allows the user to find the service and be playing very quickly, while also satisfying recurring 
            users by giving them optional registration.
